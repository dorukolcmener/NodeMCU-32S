# NodeMCU-32S Protective Case

Protective case design model for NodeMCU-32S board. No fasteners required since the cover and the base shrink fits on each other.

## Important Notes

- This model is designed only for proto 3D printing, it does not have draft angles implemented.
- Recommended filament material is >PLA<
- Conduct appropriate thermal calculation and risk management studies before using this case. Be mindful about the sharp edge regulation in your country. Understand that this is just a hobby model, and I will not be responsible of any damage that may occur.
